**Title - Detect pixelated image and correct  it**
To convert a pixelated or blurry image into a clear image, you can use techniques from deep learning, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs). One of the popular approaches is using Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Networks (SRCNNs).

Here's a basic outline of the steps you need to follow:

**Prepare Your Environment:**

**Install necessary libraries:** TensorFlow or PyTorch, OpenCV, NumPy, etc.

**Load and Preprocess Data:**
Load your pixelated/blurry images.
Preprocess the images (resize, normalize).

**Build the SRCNN Model:** Create a neural network model with convolutional layers.

**Train the Model:** Train the SRCNN model on high-resolution images and their corresponding low-resolution versions.

**Use the Model for Super-Resolution:** Feed the pixelated/blurry image into the trained model to get a high-resolution output.

**Technology used:**
1. Python(programming language)
2. PyCharm(Editor)
3. Various Machine Learnign modules and Algorithms
